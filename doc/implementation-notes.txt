For this simulation, PropertySet is not used, and instead each model
component that has multiple properties just has a set of externally
visible properties.  This was done because PropertySet seemed to confuse the
IDE, and didn't add a lot of value.

Properties are named with the suffix 'Property', e.g. positionProperty.

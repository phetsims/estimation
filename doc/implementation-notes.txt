For this simulation, PropertySet is not used, and instead each model
component that has multiple properties just has a set of externally
visible properties.  This was done because PropertySet seemed to confuse the
IDE, and didn't add a lot of value.

For this simulation, the location of a model shape is defined as the left
bottom of the shape.

In the Explore tab, all shapes are created initially and added to both the
model and view, and their visibility is changed to make them appear and
disappear.

Properties are named with the suffix 'Property', e.g. positionProperty.
